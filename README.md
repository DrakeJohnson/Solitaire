Currently I'm attending Wayzata High School and am taking AP Computer Science in which we learn fundamentals of Java and object orientated programming
This project is separate from the course and just a personal project where I can try out skills I've learned in class and continue to improve my coding skills

Large progress in the project, currently working on: 
-The scoring methods to allow moving the cards towards the top other than Aces
-Drawing 3 cards and resetting the deck, after 2 resets the player loses the game
