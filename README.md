Personal project to practice making a game, the UI is just in the output logs.

Currently I'm attending Wayzata High School and am taking AP Computer Science in which we learn fundamentals of Java and object orientated programming
This project is separate from the course and just a personal project where I can try out skills I've learned in class and continue to improve my coding skills
